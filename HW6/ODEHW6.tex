\begin{problem}
1: (5 points) 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item[(a)] 
    Given that $y = e^x$ is one solution to
\begin{center}
    $xy'' - (x + 1)y' + y = 0$,
\end{center}
use reduction of order to find the general solution to this differential equation.
    \item[(b)] 
    Use variation of parameters to find the general solution to the driven DE
\begin{center}
    $xy'' - (x + 1)y' + y = x^2e^x$.
\end{center}

\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Important note:} If you are using Abel's Theorem to reduce the order of the DE or using
the formulas for variation of parameters (instead of deriving them from scratch), make sure
that the starting point for those formulas matches your DE so that you donâ€™t misuse any
formulas.

2: (5 points) The Bessel equation of order one-half is
\begin{center}
   $x^2y''(x)+xy'(x)+\left( x^2-\frac{1}{4}\right)y(x)=0$
\end{center}

(Note that the word "order" here doesn't refer to the highest-derivative of the DE-this is
a second-order, linear, homogeneous DE and it involves the constant $1/4$, whose square root
is $1/2$.) In this problem, you may assume that $x > 0$.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item[(a)] Show that $y_1(x) = x^{-1/2}\text{cos}x$ is a solution to the Bessel equation.
    \item[(b)] Find the second solution, $y_2(x) = x^{-1/2}\text{sin}x$, using reduction of order
    \item[(c)] Show $y_1$ and $y_2$ are linearly independent and therefore form a fundamental solution set.
    \item[(d)] Find the general solution to the non-homogeneous equation
    
    \begin{center}
   $x^2y''(x)+xy'(x)+\left( x^2-\frac{1}{4}\right)y(x)=x^{5/2}$
    \end{center}
\end{enumerate}

3: Consider the nonlinear differential equation $y'(t)=4t\sqrt{y}$ with the initial condition $y(1) = y_0$.
If $y_0 = 0$, this IVP does not have a unique solution (since $y(t) = 0$ is a second solution). If
$y0 \neq 0$, this IVP has a unique solution. And yet, Wolfram Alpha and Mathematica both
give two solutions to the IVP with $y(1) = 9$.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item[(a)] First, solve the IVP with $y(1) = 9$. Try to understand why Wolfram Alpha comes up
with both solutions.
    \item[(b)] Only one of the two solutions is the correct solution to the IVP. Determine which one
is correct and why.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Note:} This problem is a great example of why computers and calculators are mathematical
aids, but they don't replace mathematically proficient humans who can think carefully. \textit{If
you use a computer or calculator to do mathematics, always check if the answer is correct
or at least reasonable.}

4: Here are five physical scenarios that involve oscillations. In each, identify the source of
damping (if it is present) that causes oscillations to die out over time, and any relevant
forcing (inputs) to the system that might cause it to oscillate.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item[(a)]Tall buildings can sway (with period of motion on the order of a few seconds)
    \item[(b)]Water sloshing around in a cup
    \item[(c)]Violins, pianos, any stringed instrument
    \item[(d)]Shock absorbers in a car
    \item[(e)](Make up your own)
\end{enumerate}

5: Examine Student P's work on the following problem. What did the student do correctly?
What mistake(s) did the student make? What is a more correct response to the problem, and
what would you say to help the student understand how to correctly complete the problem?

6: \textbf{Instructions on final project:}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Please continue to work on your Math 45 final project. We suggest each of you put in
at least three hours of work into your final project this week. Have every group member
sign your homework to demonstrate that you worked together.
    \item Strive to have each person contribute a fair and equitable amount of work and decision making
into the project.
    \item Start thinking ahead about how you want to communicate your findings to the rest of
the class. Each group is limited to 8 minutes. (We are allowing time for questions on
top of that.) Each person should have a role during the presentation. If you want to
create a set of presentation slides, look in the google drive for a PowerPoint template.
