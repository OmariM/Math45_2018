# Welcome to the Math 45 2018 Homework File Repository!

## Description / Author's Note
This is a repository for LaTeX files for Math 45 homework. This repo is designed to be a place where all TeXers alike can come together and crank out beautiful looking homework files so that we don't have to get points taken off for not copying over the problems properly. That being said, things don't always work as designed and I'm still a GitHub **noob** so if you have any questions or suggestions about how we can make this better by all means please hit me up and we can work something out!

Also, these files are made by humans. Sometimes there are mistakes. If there are--**please** let us know by making an issue in the issues tab. That being said, you as the user are responsible for making sure that the homework that you do is correct. That means if something is wrong with the TeX file, whether it be a wrong number or a missing problem, it is your responsibility to take care of that issue. Do **not** blame the person that TeXed up the homeork if there is a problem with **your** homework.

Lastly and most importantly--a lot of people put in a fair amount of time and effort into doing this for little recognition and no monetary compensation. That means they're doing this out of the charity of their own hearts. If you get the chance, **please please, PLEASE** extend your thanks to them. By doing this, they're really helping everyone out :)

## Read This If You Want To Contribute!
Thank you so so much for wanting to contribute! Let it be known that you don't have to be fluent in writing LaTeX to help out! We still need people to point out issues so that we can minimize the amount of effors in the file. With that, please be sure to read this. If anything is unclear or you have any questions, please don't hesitate to email me so we can get things sorted out quickly.

### Submitting Issues
So you've noticed a problem with the TeX file. First of all--thanks for looking and finding it! The fact that you noticed means you're attentive! Go you! Next up is for you to report that issue. First you're gonna want to scroll to the top of the page and click on the issues tab. Before you click the green "New issue" button, check to make sure that an issue has not already been created for the same thing. Now that you're on the new issue creation page, the title of the issue should be as follows: 
> Title of Homework / Problem number

So, for example:

> HW03 / 3.3 #4

Then in the description, go ahead and describe what the issue is with as much detail as necessary to a TeXer can fix it as soon as possible so everyone can reap the benefits! After that, click the "Submit new issue" button and you're all good to go!


### Uploading Files
So basically the idea is to create a platform where people can all work on making pretty math homework pdfs so that we can get them out to the people quickly. I'm still very new to GitHub so any help with optimizing this workflow would be extremely helpful. Things will more or less work like this:
1. If you haven't already, clone the repo
2. If you have a local version, pull from master before you submit anything
3. Create a new branch
4. Commit the TeX files to your branch
5. Push your branch up to remote.
6. Make a pull request
7. Wait patiently for your PR to be merged
8. If you PR is denied, find out why and make the necessary changes

If none of that made sense to you, fear not, below is a very narrowly scoped tutorial of how to get your files onto this repository:
> TODO: write the narroly scoped tutorial. I'm lazy--it'll get done sometime in the near future i promise :)
